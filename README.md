### 1. How do I approach designing software?  
Working on this project helped me see the importance of breaking a large task into smaller, modular pieces. In designing my 3D scene, I had to think not just about what objects to create but also how their construction, textures, and lighting would interact to create a coherent environment.  

I improved at visual decomposition, looking at a real-world image and breaking it down into primitives (spheres, boxes, cylinders, etc.) that could be combined to recreate the scene. I also gained experience balancing materials and lighting so that the final presentation was realistic rather than overly lit or flat.  

I started by selecting a real-world reference image, then identified which primitives could represent each object. I iterated through object creation, applied textures, adjusted lighting, and finally refined navigation and camera controls. Documenting each object and function in code kept the design organized.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs?  
Developing the 3D scene gave me hands-on experience with structured, modular programming and the iterative process of building toward a final project. This directly applies to future projects for school or career.  

Iteration was essential. For example, my initial lighting setup made the scene overly bright and lacking shadows. By iterating and repositioning lights, I achieved a softer and more realistic look. Similarly, I refined camera controls multiple times until movement felt intuitive and responsive.  

Early milestones helped me establish basic shapes and textures, but as the project progressed, I moved toward writing more reusable, modular code. By the final project, I had a structured approach where each milestone’s lessons built on the previous one, resulting in a well-structured and functional final scene.

### 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?  
This course and project showed me how computational graphics can be a valuable skill in both my educational and professional journey.  

Computational graphics strengthened my understanding of 3D transformations, lighting models, and input handling. These skills build directly on math and programming concepts I’ve learned, reinforcing topics like linear algebra and modular design. This foundation will help me in advanced computer science courses or projects that require applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems.  

In my career, the ability to visualize and simulate real-world environments can be applied to fields like software development, cybersecurity training simulations, data visualization, and even AI interfaces. Understanding how to build interactive 3D scenes also expands my ability to work with game engines, VR/AR platforms, and visualization tools that are increasingly relevant in today’s tech landscape.
